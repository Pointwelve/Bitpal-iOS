# Bitpal iOS - Comprehensive Feature List

## Overview

Bitpal is a sophisticated cryptocurrency price tracking and management application for iOS, built with **UIKit and RxSwift** using Clean Architecture principles. The app provides real-time market monitoring, intelligent price alerting, and comprehensive watchlist management for cryptocurrency investors and traders.

## Architecture Note

**Current Implementation**: The production Bitpal iOS app uses:
- **UIKit** for user interface (not SwiftUI)
- **RxSwift/RxCocoa** for reactive programming
- **Realm Database** for data persistence
- **MVVM-C Architecture** with Coordinators
- **Clean Architecture** with Domain/Data/UI separation
- **Firebase** for authentication and analytics

**Future Migration**: A SwiftUI version is planned in the `Bitpal-v2/` directory targeting iOS 18+.

## Bitpal-v2 Feature Gap Analysis

### Current Implementation Status (January 2025)

The SwiftUI v2 implementation (located in `Bitpal-v2/` directory) has successfully modernized core features but has several critical gaps compared to the production UIKit version:

#### ‚úÖ **Implemented in Bitpal-v2:**
- Basic watchlist management with SwiftData persistence
- Real-time price streaming via WebSocket (CoinDesk API)
- Price alerts system with local notifications
- Interactive charts with multiple timeframes
- Currency detail views with market statistics
- Portfolio management with holdings and transactions
- Currency search functionality
- Settings with API configuration

#### ‚ùå **Critical Missing Features:**

**Priority 1 - Essential for Production (4-6 weeks):**
1. **Widget System** - No WidgetKit widgets, Live Activities, or Control Center integration
2. **Firebase Authentication** - Missing user management, cross-device sync, anonymous user support
3. **Testing Infrastructure** - No comprehensive unit/integration tests critical for production

**Priority 2 - Important for UX (3-4 weeks):**
1. **Advanced Chart Features** - Missing candlestick charts, touch highlighting, real-time WebSocket updates
2. **Deep Linking System** - No URL schemes, push notification routing, or widget navigation
3. **Background Processing** - Missing silent notifications and background refresh coordination

**Priority 3 - Polish & Optimization (2-3 weeks):**
1. **Advanced UI Components** - No drag-and-drop reordering, advanced swipe actions, or haptic feedback
2. **3D Touch/Force Touch** - Missing preview support and enhanced interactions
3. **Production-Grade Error Handling** - Missing exponential backoff and rate limiting

#### üìã **Implementation Roadmap:**

**Phase 1:** Foundation features (Firebase Auth, WidgetKit, Testing)
**Phase 2:** Enhanced UX (Advanced charts, Deep linking, Background processing)  
**Phase 3:** Polish (Advanced UI, Haptics, Performance optimizations)
