- **Community Scalability**: Start with 1000 concurrent users, horizontal scaling plan for 10K+ users
- **Backend Architecture**: Simple forum structure initially, microservices architecture for Phase 3 scaling
- **Chart Rendering Complexity**: Progressive enhancement - basic line charts → advanced candles → glass effects
- **Memory Leaks**: Automated memory profiling, strict cleanup protocols, maximum 75MB working memory
- **Storage Optimization**: Intelligent cache partitioning: 25MB prices + 15MB charts + 10MB community
